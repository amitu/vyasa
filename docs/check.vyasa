--
every mantra needs at least one explanation
--

a mantra without an explanation is incomplete. the explanation provides
context, examples, and reasoning that help others understand the mantra.

--
vyasa check verifies all mantras have explanations
--

the check command is the primary validation tool. it scans all vyasa files
in the repository and ensures that [every mantra needs at least one explanation].

--
check reports unexplained mantras with file and line
--

when a mantra lacks an explanation, vyasa check outputs the file path and
line number where the mantra was defined, along with a truncated preview
of the mantra text. this helps you locate and fix the issue quickly.

--
vyasa check exits with non zero exit code if any rule is violated
--

the check command validates multiple rules: explanations, empty line spacing,
and reference validity. if any rule is violated, vyasa check returns exit
code 1. this makes it suitable for CI pipelines or git hooks.

--
check validates empty line spacing around delimiters
--

[before / after -- must contain at least one empty line, unless at start/end of file]
is enforced by check. violations are reported with file and line number so
you can fix the spacing issues.

--
check exits with code 0 when all mantras are explained
--

when every mantra in the repository has at least one explanation, the
command prints a success message and exits cleanly. the message includes
the total count of mantras checked.

--
check accepts a path argument
--

by default, vyasa check scans the current directory. you can pass a path
to check a specific folder or file: `vyasa check ./docs` or even
`vyasa check ./docs/syntax.vyasa`.

--
vyasa check reports undefined references
--

every reference must match a defined mantra - either exactly or through
template matching. if a reference like `[some undefined mantra]` appears
but no matching mantra exists, check reports it as an error.
