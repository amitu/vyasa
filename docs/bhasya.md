> **^a bhasya is a mantra with its commentary^** - the term comes from Sanskrit
> meaning "commentary" or "explanation". in vyasa, a bhasya is the complete
> teaching unit: the mantra text plus its accompanying commentary.

> **^bhasyas use quote block syntax^** - a bhasya is written as a markdown quote
> block containing `**^mantra^**` followed by commentary text. the entire quote
> block forms one bhasya.

> **^one mantra can have multiple bhasyas^** - the same mantra text can appear in
> different files with different commentaries. each occurrence is a separate
> bhasya providing a different perspective or context.

> **^canon stores accepted bhasyas^** - when you accept a mantra into canon, you're
> accepting a specific bhasya (mantra + commentary pair). the commentary in canon
> becomes the canonical explanation.
