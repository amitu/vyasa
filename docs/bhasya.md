> **^a bhasya is a mantra with its commentary^** - the term comes from Sanskrit
> meaning "commentary" or "explanation". in vyasa, a bhasya is the complete
> teaching unit: the mantra text plus its accompanying commentary.

> **^bhasyas use quote block syntax^** - a bhasya is written as a markdown quote
> block containing `**^mantra^**` followed by commentary text. the entire quote
> block forms one bhasya.

> **^one mantra can have multiple bhasyas^** - the same mantra text can appear in
> different files with different commentaries. each occurrence is a separate
> bhasya providing a different perspective or context.

> **^deprecated bhasyas use double angle bracket^** - when a bhasya is deprecated
> (no longer recommended), prefix the quote block with `>>` instead of `>`.
> deprecated mantras are still recognized but flagged by vyasa check.

> **^shastra prefix quotes from external sources^** - to quote a bhasya from
> another shastra (knowledge repository), add `shastra: name` on the line
> immediately before the quote block. vyasa check verifies the quoted mantra
> exists in the source shastra.
