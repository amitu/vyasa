--
vyasa values cli can query placeholder in file/directory, and filter mantras or even keys
--

the values command extracts all instantiated placeholder values from template
mantra references. this lets you see what concrete values are being used
throughout your repository.

--
vyasa mantra filename is optional, can be folder or pattern
--

the path argument can be a file, folder, or glob pattern. if omitted, it
defaults to the current directory. examples: `vyasa values ./docs`,
`vyasa values ./docs/templates.vyasa`.

--
values groups results by template and key
--

output is organized first by template mantra, then by placeholder key within
that template. for each key, it shows the unique values found and where they
were first referenced.

--
values --mantra filters by exact mantra reference
--

use the -m or --mantra flag with a mantra reference to filter results.
the mantra should be in bracket notation: `vyasa values --mantra="[user: {username}]"`.
the brackets are optional: `vyasa values --mantra="user: {username}"` also works.

--
values --key filters by placeholder key name
--

use the -k or --key flag to filter results to a specific placeholder key.
for example, `vyasa values --key=username` shows only values bound to the
{username} placeholder across all templates.

--
values shows file and line for each value
--

each extracted value includes the file path and line number where it was
first used. this helps you trace values back to their usage context.

--
values deduplicates values per key
--

if the same value appears multiple times for the same placeholder, it's
shown only once with the location of its first occurrence. the count of
unique values is displayed for each key.
