--
.vyasa/config.vyasa file can use mantra reference
--

the config file lives at .vyasa/config.vyasa in your repository root. it can
reference mantras to configure vyasa's behavior. this means your configuration
is itself expressed in mantra form.

--
config file is optional
--

vyasa works without a config file using sensible defaults. the config file
lets you customize behavior when needed.

--
config references are validated
--

when you reference a mantra in config.vyasa, vyasa verifies that mantra
exists in your repository. this catches typos and ensures your configuration
references real knowledge.
