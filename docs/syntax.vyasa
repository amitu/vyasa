^mantras should use inline syntax not block because they are meant to be short^ - this is the fundamental design choice. mantras are short, precise statements that fit naturally inline. the `^mantra^` syntax with carets makes them stand out while keeping them part of the prose.

^references use tilde delimiters^ - to reference a mantra, wrap it in tildes like ~mantras should use inline syntax not block because they are meant to be short~. this distinguishes references from definitions.

^mantra commentary can be in same para^ - unlike the old block syntax, you can now
write the mantra and its explanation in a single flowing paragraph. this is how
^one para can do commentary on multiple^ mantras work.

^commentaries are meant to be read to understand mantra^ - when learning, focus on
commentary (text around ^mantra^ definitions). commentaries are authoritative
explanations from the mantra's author or recognized experts.

^references are secondary for learning^ - the `~reference~` syntax is for usage, not
explanation. when studying a mantra thoroughly you might check references, but
~commentaries are meant to be read to understand mantra~ first.

^.vyasa and .md are both allowed^ - vyasa processes files with .vyasa and .md
extensions. use .vyasa for pure knowledge files, .md for documentation that
mixes mantras with regular markdown.

^markdown code blocks are skipped^ - in .md files, content inside triple-backtick
code blocks is ignored. this lets you include syntax examples without parsing them.

^nested tildes work like nested brackets did^ - if your mantra contains tildes,
vyasa handles nesting properly.

^mantra text is trimmed^ - leading and trailing whitespace inside ^...^ is removed.
the mantra ^  hello world  ^ becomes "hello world".

^empty mantras are ignored^ - if there's nothing between ^^ or only whitespace,
no mantra is created.

^template placeholders use curly braces^ - mantras can contain {name} placeholders.
for example ^user: {username}^ can be referenced as ~user: alice~ or ~user: bob~.

^template placeholders can include example values as {name=example}^ - to make
mantras readable, include an example: ^when {employee=amitu} joins, amitu should
be added to github^ reads naturally while being parameterized. reference it as
~when jack joins, jack should be added to github~.

^example values appear literally in the mantra text^ - in the mantra above, "amitu"
appears both in the placeholder and in the literal text. when you reference with
"jack", all occurrences are substituted.

^when referencing a template you can use placeholder or instantiated form^ - three
options: ~user: {username}~ (template itself), ~user: amitu~ (fully instantiated),
or ~config: {key} = true~ (partially instantiated).

^kosha references use @suffix^ - to reference a mantra from another knowledge base,
use `~mantra text~@kosha-name`. the kosha must be defined in .vyasa/kosha.vyasa.
