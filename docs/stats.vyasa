vyasa stats shows repository statistics
--

the stats command gives you an overview of your knowledge repository.
it counts mantras, explanations, references, and shows usage patterns.

--
stats displays mantra count
--

the first statistic shown is the total number of unique mantras defined
in the repository. each mantra is counted once, even if explained in
multiple places.

--
stats displays explanation count
--

this shows how many mantras have at least one explanation. ideally this
equals the mantra count - if not, run [vyasa check verifies all mantras
have explanations] to find the gaps.

--
stats displays reference count
--

the total number of times mantras are referenced using [square bracket]
syntax. a mantra referenced five times in different places adds five to
this count.

--
stats displays unreferenced mantra count
--

mantras that are defined and explained but never referenced elsewhere.
these might be foundational concepts or possibly orphaned knowledge that
could be pruned.

--
stats shows popular mantras with more than 10 references
--

if any mantras have been referenced more than 10 times, they're listed
separately as "popular mantras". these are your core concepts - the ideas
that recur throughout your knowledge base.

--
stats shows a reference histogram
--

the histogram groups mantras by how often they're referenced. by default
it uses up to 10 buckets, but you can customize this with --buckets.

--
histogram buckets adapt to the data
--

[histogram uses at most N buckets where N is configurable]. if your max
reference count is 3, you'll only see 3 buckets, not 10 empty ones.

--
histogram uses at most N buckets where N is configurable
--

pass --buckets to control the maximum bucket count: `vyasa stats --buckets 5`.
the histogram will use fewer buckets if the data range is smaller.

--
histogram trims empty edge buckets
--

empty buckets at the start and end of the histogram are hidden. only
empty buckets between non-empty ones are shown, making the output cleaner.

--
stats --buckets 0 shows individual counts
--

when you set buckets to zero, vyasa skips the histogram entirely and
lists each referenced mantra with its exact reference count, sorted from
most to least referenced.
