## correcting knowledge

> **^khandita does not create a counter-mantra^** - when you refute a bhasya from
> another shastra, you don't create a new mantra explaining why. such a counter-mantra
> would live forever in history, accumulating references.

> **^khandita expects the source to tyakta^** - the purpose of khandita is to signal
> disagreement and pressure the source shastra to reconsider. the expectation is that
> they will eventually tyakta (abandon) the flawed bhasya.

> **^tyakta cascades through dependents^** - when a source shastra tyaktas a bhasya,
> everyone who quoted it (uddhrit) gets an error. they must either remove their quote
> or convert it to khandita, propagating the correction through the knowledge graph.

> **^bad branches collapse into ether^** - as tyakta cascades, entire branches of
> flawed knowledge collapse. the traces remain only where needed: the original shastra
> keeps the tyakta as a tombstone, and khanditas document the disagreement that led
> to abandonment.

> **^tombstones can eventually be removed^** - once enough time has passed and the
> correction is widely known, even the tyakta tombstone can be removed from the
> original shastra. or it can remain forever as a historical record of a failed idea.

> **^conflicts between shastras must be resolved^** - if you follow two shastras
> and one khandits a bhasya while the other uddhrits it, you cannot silently
> inherit both positions. you must explicitly take a side by adding your own
> khandita or uddhrit.

> **^no implicit positions on disputed knowledge^** - vyasa forces you to be
> explicit about disputed knowledge. you cannot hide behind "I just follow X and Y"
> when X and Y disagree. your shastra must state its position.
