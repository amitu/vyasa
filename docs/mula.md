> **^a mula mantra is the root definition^** - the term "mula" comes from Sanskrit
> meaning "root" or "source". in vyasa, a mula mantra (मूल मंत्र) is the original
> definition using `**^mantra^**` syntax inside a quote block.

> **^mula mantras use bold caret syntax^** - write `**^your mantra text^**` to define
> a mula mantra. this creates the root/canonical form of the knowledge.

> **^mula mantra vs anusrit^** - a mula mantra defines knowledge (`**^mantra^**`), while
> an anusrit uses that knowledge (`_| mantra |_`). one mula mantra can have many
> anusrits throughout the repository.

> **^mula mantra requires commentary^** - every mula mantra must appear in a quote
> block with commentary explaining it. the mantra alone is not enough; the
> bhasya (mantra + commentary) forms the complete teaching unit.
