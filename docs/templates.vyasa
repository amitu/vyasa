user: {username}
--

this template mantra represents a user with a given username. you can
reference it as [user: alice] or [user: bob] and vyasa will recognize
these as instances of the same template.

--
config: {key} = {value}
--

a template for configuration entries. reference as [config: debug = true]
or [config: port = 8080]. multiple placeholders are supported.

here are some example references:

fully instantiated:
- [user: alice] is a valid user
- [user: bob] is another valid user
- [config: theme = dark] sets the theme

with placeholders (referring to the template itself):
- [user: {username}] defines a user template
- [config: {key} = {value}] defines a config template

partially instantiated:
- [config: debug = {value}] - key is "debug", value varies
- [config: {key} = true] - any key that's set to true
