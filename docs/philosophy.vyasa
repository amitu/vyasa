prose interferes with knowledge organization
--

this is the foundational insight behind vyasa. when we write freely, we
paraphrase, elaborate, and drift from precise formulations. this feels
natural but undermines the goal of preserving exact knowledge.

--
knowledge requires exact wording
--

unlike casual writing, knowledge should be stated precisely. the wording
matters. when we reference an idea, we should reference *that exact idea*,
not a paraphrase that might subtly shift the meaning.

--
mantras are canonical formulations
--

a mantra is the authoritative way to express an idea. once defined, it
should not change without careful consideration. [mantras should not
change once defined] - this resistance to change is a feature.

--
repetition reinforces precision
--

because [mantras must be spelled out in full at each reference], you
can't hide behind abbreviations or nicknames. every reference is a
recommitment to the exact formulation.

--
drift becomes visible
--

if you want to change how something is worded, you must explicitly create
a new mantra. the old and new versions can coexist, making the evolution
of your thinking visible rather than hidden in subtle rewording.

--
explanations are non-normative
--

the mantra is the knowledge. explanations are just commentary - helpful
for understanding, but not authoritative. when in doubt, trust the mantra,
not the explanation surrounding it.

--
vyasa isn't really needed
--

the tool is secondary to the discipline. you could practice this approach
with any text editor. vyasa just helps verify you're following the rules
and gives you statistics about your knowledge base.

--
the value is in the habit
--

what matters is developing the mental discipline of careful, minimal,
canonical knowledge representation. the tool is a reminder and a helper,
but the real work happens in your mind as you formulate ideas precisely.
