# Bhasya

A _| shastra |_ without structure is just a pile of text. The reader drowns in
prose, unable to find what matters. _| bhasya |_ solves this - it's how you mark
the important parts.

> **^bhasya^** - a quote block containing a _| mantra |_ with its authoritative
> commentary. The fundamental unit of knowledge worth preserving in a
> _| shastra |_.

When you write a _| bhasya |_, you are making a commitment. You are saying: this
specific formulation matters. Not the paragraphs around it, not the rambling
explanations - this exact text, in this exact form.

The quote block syntax (`>`) visually separates _| bhasya |_ from supporting
prose. When scanning a document, your eye catches these blocks. They stand out.
This is intentional - _| bhasya |_ are meant to be found, remembered, referenced.

A _| bhasya |_ must contain at least one _| mantra |_ - the concept being
defined or discussed. Without a _| mantra |_, it's just a quote, not a
_| bhasya |_. The _| mantra |_ anchors the _| bhasya |_, gives it an identity,
makes it addressable.

The commentary following the _| mantra |_ is equally important. A bare
_| mantra |_ without explanation is a riddle. The commentary unpacks the
meaning, provides context, resolves ambiguity. Together, _| mantra |_ and
commentary form a complete unit of transmissible knowledge.
