# CHALLENGES TO shastra/shastra.md

## ON THE BHASYA ITSELF (lines 41-43):

1. Contradiction between prose and bhasya. Your prose says shastra is "personal", for "pupils/children", "not for wide distribution". But your bhasya says "repository of knowledge" - that's generic, institutional language. Wikipedia is a repository of knowledge. Which is it - personal or repository?
2. "Authoritative" according to whom? You say shastra contains "authoritative definitions". But earlier you said it's just what one person found "satisfactory or useful". That's subjective preference, not authority. A flat-earther's shastra would contain their "authoritative" definitions. The word "authoritative" is doing no work here, or worse, it's misleading.
3. "Tutorials, explanations" vs "bhasya". Your bhasya says shastra contains "bhasya" AND "supporting material (tutorials, explanations)". But later (line 50-51) you say bhasya IS "things worth reading/remembering/propagating". So are tutorials worth remembering or not? If yes, they should be bhasya. If no, why include them?

## ON THE PROSE:

4. "Accepted by a person" - what does acceptance mean? I can accept that gravity exists. I can accept a job offer. I can accept responsibility. Which kind of acceptance? Belief? Endorsement? Adoption into practice?
5. Guru-shishya framing is culturally limiting. You assume a teacher-student relationship. What about peer-to-peer knowledge sharing? What about self-study? What about institutional knowledge bases? You're excluding valid use cases or forcing them into an ill-fitting metaphor.
6. "Not a way to make money" - why not? This seems like your personal preference, not a definitional requirement. If I sell my shastra as a book, does it stop being shastra? The Bhagavad Gita is sold. Is it not shastra?
7. "Personal document... so they can understand the person." Is the goal to understand the PERSON or to understand the KNOWLEDGE? These are different. A physics textbook helps me understand physics, not the author's personality.
8. You admit to rambling in line 20-24. If you can't demonstrate discipline in a document ABOUT discipline, why should anyone trust the method? This undermines your own credibility.

## LOGICAL GAPS:

9. No definition of what makes something "worth" preserving. You say we need to "call out" things worth reading. But what's the criterion? Popular? True? Useful? Beautiful? You've given no principle for selection.
10. The problem you describe (too much text) isn't solved. You say people face "a mountain of text" and won't wade through it. But adding bhasyas doesn't reduce the mountain - it just puts flags on some peaks. The mountain is still there.
11. Why quote blocks? You never justify why the > syntax specifically. Is it just markdown convenience? Would bold work? Headers? Why this particular demarcation?

## HARDER QUESTIONS:

12. Can a shastra be wrong? You focus on personal satisfaction and usefulness. But what if someone's shastra contains errors, harmful advice, or lies? Is a shastra of misinformation still a shastra?
13. What's the difference between shastra and a blog? Both are personal, both contain things the author finds worth sharing, both have some "important" posts and some rambling. What makes shastra distinct?
14. Why should anyone read YOUR shastra over the thousands of others? You've described a format, not a value proposition. What makes vyasa-shastra more worth reading than any random Medium article?
15. What happens when shastras conflict? Two gurus, two shastras, contradictory bhasyas about the same mantra. What then? You mention "shastrartha" casually but don't formalize how disputes resolve.

## MISSING:

16. No versioning story. Knowledge evolves. How does a shastra update? Can bhasyas be deprecated?
17. No quality control. Anyone can write **^anything^**. What separates legitimate bhasya from noise?
18. No relationship between shastras. You mention "observed shastra" elsewhere but not here. How do shastras build on each other?
