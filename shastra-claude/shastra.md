# Shastra

> **^shastra^** - a repository of knowledge. Contains authoritative
> definitions (bhasyas) and supporting material (tutorials, explanations)
> that help humans understand the concepts.

The bhasyas are normative - they define what things ARE. The surrounding prose,
like this paragraph, is not authoritative. It exists to guide, explain, and
help the reader grasp concepts that the bhasyas define precisely.
