# _| mantra |_

So a _| mantra |_ is loosely a concept, a formula, axiom, a statement of law or 
some such, and we are intentionally being vague because it is impossible to not
be vague in natural or even precise languages, for example Gödel's 
Incompleteness Theorems.

The job of a _| mantra |_ is to try to bring some sort of precision to the
concept being discussed.
