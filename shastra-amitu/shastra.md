# Shastra

Shastra is collection of knowledge accepted by a person. A set of knowledge that
this person has personally found satisfactory or useful in their life. The 
primary audience of a shastra is the pupils, students, who declare this person
their personal guru. Or the children of that person maintaining the shastra, as
this is what they want to pass on to their kids, so their kids do not make the
same mistakes, or benefit from the same gyan this person benefited from.

Shastra is not a way to make money, not for wide distribution, it's a personal
document, open for people around that person, so they can understand the person.

Not everything a person keeps in their shastra is for everyone's scrutiny, the
system we are proposing works on files, but a separate system can control what
files are visible to this tool in which context, so fine-grained access control
are possible, and recommended, but beyond the scope of this tool.

It is easy to write diaries and letters and personal notes etc, but they tend
to ramble, at least I do, this is my shastra about the tool called vyasa, or 
amitu's vyasa shastra. I can have more shastra, maybe an un-differentiated 
shastra, just called amitu's shastra, and you can see evidence of rambling this
very paragraph.

Not everything written is worth reading / remembering / propagating, but then
if nothing is read / remembered / propagated we suffer too. So we need to 
call-out portions that are carefully written, for the purpose of being widely
read (by people who consider the author of shastra worth reading). Say you liked
some of the stuff I wrote, and wanted to learn more, but then you are faced with
a mountain of text I have written, you are not going to have time to wade 
through all that, so that is one problem. You can distribute or try to remember
that entire volume of text, but that will fail, even I can not remember most I
write, nor will I spam anyone with all I have written.

With that in mind we are creating this tool, which helps you demarcate things,
call out things, that then you can dedicate more focus / attention on.

So the first think I want to invite your attention to is:

> **^shastra^** - a repository of knowledge. Contains authoritative
> definitions (bhasyas) and supporting material (tutorials, explanations)
> that help humans understand the concepts.

You are reading this in a github repository called amitu/vyasa, which is one
way to distribute shastra, and is called a repository of knowledge. You can
distribute shastra as a zip file, or even a single text file, or as a series
of social media posts and so forth.

I quoted text above is kind of a bhasya, a unit of things worth reading / 
remembering / propagating / preserving as per the author of the shastra. We will
talk in detail about bhasya later on. They are the primary purpose of a shastra.

And a shastra can contain other text, like if you are reading this document, one
para is specially called out, but the rest of the text is some sort of supporting
material, an explanation, something to help people understand.
