# Objections

There are a lot of people in the world, billions, and each with their own views.
No vyasa shastra, as defined by this document, and this is the general principle,
you are not responsible for things you did not write, nor are you interested in
much in attacks, unless the attacks start becoming personal, in which case it
probably smart to limit distribution of your views to even fewer who want to learn
and are not primarily interested in attacking. There are just far too many people
interested in attacking others instead of doing what they aught to do in their
personal lives.

If someone is reading your words and NOT declaring you someone they want to learn
from, they are fools for wasting their time. Do NOT bother reading their words,
again, unless you want to learn from them, include their lessons in your shastra
etc.

## Tykta and khandita

Vyasa allows shastras to tyakta, meaning abandon their own positions, or one
to khandita/reject bhasyas in other shastras. The system is a living system,
a dialog, a position is expressed by a shastra, and another shastra can take
a counter position and present their arguments for why they are rejecting the
original position, allowing observers of the shastra to see the refutal.

## Everyone Has Their Own Shastra

The observer of a shastra is also writing a shastra, every human being accepting 
to participate in this system is to maintain a shastra that they personally are
maintaining, they are personally going to pass on to their own.

The vyasa system does not have any status of special shastra, just the shastra
you are choosing to observe, and it helps surface inconsistencies, say if you
follow two shastra, and one holds a position and the other rejects that position,
vyasa tool tells you about this contradiction, and asks you to make up your
own mind about this.

## Astika vs Nastika objections

When an objection is made, it can come from one of the two sources, one is from
people who fundamentally agree with the shastra, _| shastra astika |_, and from
people who fundamentally disagree with the shastra, the _| shastra nastika |_.

The object does not become invalid or valid based on where it came from, but
where it came from is a useful filter for _| shastra |_ maintainer to decide
what to focus their limited time and energy on. If the objection is you are
largely correct, the person who is maintaining the shastra is telling you what
they are telling their kids or loved ones, people they work with etc, they are
entitled to their views, and if your view about that person is that person is
not your kind of person, you would not want to be with them, or are running some
campaign against them, and based on that you are making objections, and if you
are honest about it, the shastra maintainer can chose to focus on objections
they loved ones may be making about some minor improvement to help refine the
shastra.

Shastra astika agree with shastra, not in absolute terms, but as a generally
useful work to help with their lives, and they want to help refine the shastra
to make it more precise, cover more cases, resolve ambiguities etc.

Shastra nastika kind of probably want the shastra shut down, person stopped or
some such, and well, they probably can not help improve the shastra much, tho
some of the common objections could be included in the shastra, to help reduce
the noise created by such people.

Nothing can satisfy the billions we are. Nothing is absolute. You pick what you
like, what you want to hear, what you want to repeat.

Astikas are saying "Hey, I follow your shastra, I am asking my kids etc to also
follow it by constantly taking your bhasya and putting them in mine, but I have 
got this problem when I started adding this bhasya". And nastika go "Hey, I do 
not like your shastra, and I am rejecting most of your bhasyas, I have copied 
nothing from your bhasya, you suck".


## I hate your usage of Sanskrit terms

"I rever them or hate them, but I have my own views on these terms that you are
trying to redefine / appropriate etc."

I am not sure what to say. I like those terms. I tried looking at a collection
of such terms in English, which is a second language for me, and not much really
I can do about it. PR to create localisation in this software is def welcome,
I am happy to create a term mapping, even let you rename the vyasa binary and
embed some automatic term selection based on the name of binary or environment
variable etc. A shastra maintained by a person will use the terms they picked,
so of course if you follow someone's shastra and they pick a language, you will
have to talk to them about it.

## Shastra Relativism / Refusal of Absolutism

A common objection is not using the words/mantra/concepts used in a shastra in
the way the shastra uses, which we call shastra relativism, say if a shastra is
using mula mantra form for a mantra, they are re-defining that mantra/concept,
and any further reading of that shastra must use that re-definition, instead of
harping on but the absolute / authoritative etc definitions of those mantras.

## Internal Inconsistency vs Unwelcome outcome

When one prepares a astika objection, they are trying to largely find one of the
two, maybe more but at least these are good classes objections: objections that
challenge internal consistency of shastra in a shastra astika reading. And second
if objections on the grounds that shastra astika reading leads to unwelcome
real world outcomes/consequences, and shastra must be updated to either special
case these, or to abandon those positions.
