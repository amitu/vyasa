# _| shastra |_

_| shastra |_ is collection of knowledge accepted by a person. A set of knowledge
that this person has personally found satisfactory or useful in their life. The
primary audience of a _| shastra |_ is the pupils, students, who declare this
person their personal guru. Or the children of that person maintaining the
_| shastra |_, as this is what they want to pass on to their kids, so their kids
do not make the same mistakes, or benefit from the same gyan this person
benefited from.

_| shastra |_ is not a way to make money, not for wide distribution, it's a
personal document, open for people around that person, so they can understand
the person.

Not everything a person keeps in their _| shastra |_ is for everyone's scrutiny,
the system we are proposing works on files, but a separate system can control
what files are visible to this tool in which context, so fine-grained access
control are possible, and recommended, but beyond the scope of this tool.

It is easy to write diaries and letters and personal notes etc, but they tend
to ramble, at least I do, this is my _| shastra |_ about the tool called vyasa,
or amitu's vyasa _| shastra |_. I can have more _| shastra |_, maybe an
un-differentiated _| shastra |_, just called amitu's _| shastra |_, and you can
see evidence of rambling this very paragraph.

Not everything written is worth reading / remembering / propagating, but then
if nothing is read / remembered / propagated we suffer too. So we need to
call-out portions that are carefully written, for the purpose of being widely
read (by people who consider the author of _| shastra |_ worth reading). Say you
liked some of the stuff I wrote, and wanted to learn more, but then you are
faced with a mountain of text I have written, you are not going to have time to
wade through all that, so that is one problem. You can distribute or try to
remember that entire volume of text, but that will fail, even I can not remember
most I write, nor will I spam anyone with all I have written.

With that in mind we are creating this tool, which helps you demarcate things,
call out things, that then you can dedicate more focus / attention on.

So the first think I want to invite your attention to is:

> **^shastra^** - a repository of knowledge. Contains authoritative
> definitions (_| bhasya |_) and supporting material (tutorials, explanations)
> that help humans understand the concepts.

You are reading this in a github repository called amitu/vyasa, which is one
way to distribute _| shastra |_, and is called a repository of knowledge. You
can distribute _| shastra |_ as a zip file, or even a single text file, or as a
series of social media posts and so forth.

I quoted text above is kind of a _| bhasya |_, a unit of things worth reading /
remembering / propagating / preserving as per the author of the _| shastra |_.
We will talk in detail about _| bhasya |_ later on. They are the primary purpose
of a _| shastra |_.

And a _| shastra |_ can contain other text, like if you are reading this
document, one para is specially called out, but the rest of the text is some
sort of supporting material, an explanation, something to help people understand.
