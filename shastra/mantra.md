# _| mantra |_

So a _| mantra |_ is loosely a concept, a formula, axiom, a statement of law or 
some such, and we are intentionally being vague because it is not always 
possible to not be vague in natural or even precise languages, for example 
Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems.

The job of a _| mantra |_ is to try to bring some sort of precision to the
concept being discussed. 

## _| mula mantra |_ vs _| mantra anusrit |_

So one uses _| bhashya |_ to comment on, establish, clarify, define _| mantra 
|_'s. As we have said earlier, _| every mantra has at least one bhasya |_. When
a bhasya mentions a mantra it can refer to a mantra in it's mula mantra sense
or in a reference sense. If a bhasya is trying to make authoritative / important
statement / clarification about the mantra, such that to understand this mantra
you must read this bhasya, it uses the mula mantra syntax. If the bhasya is
using other mantras to explain the mula mantra, we call that mantra reference 
or mantra anusrit.

The idea is if you want to understand a mantra, what does it really mean, 
important aspects of this mantra, you should study the bhasyas that use this
mantra in mula mantra sense, but if you come across a bhasya using some mantra 
anustric, mantra reference, you are expected to properly understand those 
mantras properly by studying all bhasyas (across all shastra you observe, 
recursively, as any shastra you observe can in tern observe other shastra, and
the entire tree must be studied to first understand the referenced mantras before
understanding other mantras that are defined using a mantra).
