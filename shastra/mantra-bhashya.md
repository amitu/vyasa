# _| mantra |_ and _| bhasya |_

So in [shastra](shastra.md) we discussed what purpose of _| shastra |_ is to
help call out things, and we do it in two forms, _| mantra |_ and _| bhasya |_.

A _| mantra |_ is the unit that should be really memorized if you intend to 
really use the explained thing without error in practice for years and decades.
Our minds tend to simplify, to add additions and make modifications as context
deems fit, and it a great feature, but it leads to drift. The words no longer
have the same meaning they had when you agreed with whoever you agreed with last
leading to conflicts and schisms when it was probably not needed.

No one is saying a concept should be accepted, but that that exact wording of 
the concept be used to precisely refer to things, so we can then more 
intelligently talk about it, without having to resort to what did you mean by
this, or having to constantly have to say oh I simplified, or I really meant
something else, I was misheard/misquoted etc.

Intelligent, well-meaning people quibble because of this reason, not agreeing
to the names of the concepts being discussed, over or under generalizing words
spoken by each other etc.

Mantra acts like a longish name, but is meant not just as the name but the exact
concept, like $e = mc^2$, or "circle is locus of points equidistant from a 
given point", such sentences are called _| mantra |_ in _| vyasa |_. 

> **^ mantra ^** - a precisely-worded statement meant to invoke a specific idea.
> Examples: $e=mc^2$, "circle is locus of points equidistant from a given 
> point". **^ mantra must be repeated verbatim ^** to prevent drift.

The _| mantra |_ helps people first agree on a precise concept being discussed.

But with such formulas, e.g. $e = mc^2$, we still have possible doubts, what do 
you mean by mass, is it rest mass or mass observed by some other observer, or 
what is energy really, and thus we need what we call _| bhasya |_.

> A **^ bhasya ^** is an authoritative / normative / important / agreed upon
> commentary or explanation about one or more _| mantra |_. **^ every mantra
> has at least one bhasya ^**. And **^ bhasya must be repeated verbatim ^**

As you see I have introduced a bunch of rules / statements about a bunch of
interconnected concepts, created new mantras like _| bhasya must be repeated 
verbatim |_, and in two _| bhasya |_ in this document I tried to explained five
unique _| mantra |_.
