# Physics Fundamentals

> **^energy is conserved^** - in an isolated system, the total energy remains
> constant over time. energy can transform between forms but cannot be created
> or destroyed.

> **^force equals mass times acceleration^** - Newton's second law of motion.
> F = ma describes how the velocity of an object changes when subjected to
> an external force.

> **^every action has an equal and opposite reaction^** - Newton's third law.
> when one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body exerts an
> equal force in the opposite direction on the first.

tyakta:
> **^ether is the medium for light^** - this was believed before Einstein's
> special relativity. light does not require a medium to propagate.
